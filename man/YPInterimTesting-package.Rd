	Interim Monitoring Using Adaptively Weighted Log-rank Test in Clinical Trials
}
\description{
This package provides monitoring boundary for interim testing using the adaptively weighted log-rank test developed by Yang and Prentice (2010). A re-sampling method is used instead of the originally proposed method. It is shown in Yang (2017) that the adaptively weighted log-rank test is asymptotically fully efficient when the limiting censoring distributions in two groups are equal. For a given spending function, the main function of the package \code{ypinterim} provides stopping boundaries at the interim looks, along with nominal p-values.

The object being returned by the function \code{\link{ypinterim}} can be formatted to a table using the function \code{\link{summary}}.
